# Frontiers3Dmorphology
Repository of data created and analyzed for the study: Colony-level 3D photogrammetry reveals that total linear extension and initial growth do not scale with complex morphological growth in the branching coral, Acropora cervicornis.


Acer3DMorphologyData.csv -> csv file containing phenotype data for 156 coral colonies used in the experiment
ImageCaptureSpecs.csv  -> csv file containing the number of photographs used to build individual coral models from 6 and 12 months in addition to the colony measurements, n= 427 and includes all models built in the experiment including colonies that were excluded due to incomplete data across the 3 time points
ModelOutputSpecs.xlsx  -> excel file containing Metashape output details for 200 coral models built for this study
ModelPrecisionSpecs.csv -> csv file containing measurements for technical replicates of a single coral model used for assessing the precision of the 3D photogrammetry method
